# Seq2Seq-Translation
Implemented a transformer for a language translation task. 

To understand the performance of the transformer, we compared it to RNN seq2seq models with and without attention from [this tutorial](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/seq2seq-translation/seq2seq-translation.ipynb). Note that the implementation for the transformer was based on [this beginner tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/translation_transformer.html) and was modified accordingly for our dataset.
